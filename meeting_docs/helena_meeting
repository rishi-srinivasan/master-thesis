Helena Notes:
IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) for thesis
In intro --> What is the company, Who are they, what they need
In research part --> What are the state-of-art approach used in the thesis
Research part goes to part 2, where new techs are used, add research there next to it adding references
Talk about:
	AWS --> data sent across AWS, data sent across google, gdpr, trump accused germany to US
	Costs in cloud, societal costs as well
	Mention about data ethics involved as well in chatbot
Mention examples everywhere the writing becomes complex so they understand that I fully understand what I am doing
Write how you failed and how you modified and made it work in (6. Implementation)
